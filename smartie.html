    <div class="article-title">Snorting Smarties Will Kill You Instantly, Experts Scream</div>
    <div class="author">By Trisha Calamity | April 8, 2025</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>If you or someone you know has even sniffed a Smarties wrapper today, you may be entitled to a funeral. In an alarming rise of absolute chaos, teens have started snorting Smarties — and according to reports that may or may not exist, this results in <strong>guaranteed instant death</strong>.</p>

      <p>“Just one roll is all it takes,” said Dr. Morty Dreadwell, a guy in a lab coat we found pacing outside a gas station. “One roll is actually <em>more lethal</em> than snorting plutonium dust off a cactus in space.”</p>

      <p>Experts believe the Smartie particles travel directly to the brain and explode like tiny sugary bombs. Symptoms include: becoming extremely cool for 2 seconds, sneezing chalk, and spontaneous disappearance from the mortal realm.</p>

      <p>The CDC (Cool Dude Committee) has issued a Level 9000 Warning: “Do not snort Smarties. Ever. Not even one. ESPECIALLY not one. One roll is a one-way ticket to the grave.”</p>

      <p>Globul Articles reached out to the Smarties company for comment. They screamed and hung up.</p>

      <p>Stay safe. Stay smart. Don’t Smartie-snort. Or do, but only if you're already immortal.</p>
